# Project Title

## Description
Logisitc Regression (LR), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and BERT model are tested and compared under different settings of data (sizes, distribution, bias etc...)
## Prerequisites
See the start of src.py file to understand the packages needed for this project.

If you wish to see model's on biased data, uncomment line 2 and line 20-29 in main.py file, bias data is pre-set, if you wish to create customized biased dataset, changes needs to be made in function bias_data and bias_datasplit in src.py file.
